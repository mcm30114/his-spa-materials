Idea: random slideshow of patterns to inspire audience

To work on:

Of course, you need to make sure your QCON talk this week is done and the UKUUG talk is nailed too.  It's just that the SPA slides look like notes rather than finished slides. ("What to Do" even has an empty bullet at the bottom.)  People will be expecting a bit more context and guidance than this.  The timetable suggests that the first 15 minutes are going to be presentation, including "quick run through of existing patterns" ... this is all still to be added?  You need to give people concrete examples of the kind of thing you expect them to do, otherwise long experience suggests that they just flail around.

Also, I'd suggest developing a simple form to guide people through the information to capture for their patterns.  It's a very simple prop which you wouldn't think would have much effect, but it really seems to help people to have boxes to put thoughts into rather than be faced with an empty page!
